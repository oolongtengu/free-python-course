# Counting Elements

Given a list `my_list`, how can you know how many elements does it have? The answer is simple: the `len` function:

```python
my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c']

print(len(my_list))  # 3

my_list.append('d')

new_length = len(my_list)
print(new_length)  # 4
```

We usually refer to "counting elements" as _"getting the **length** of a list"_. You can associate the `len` function with the **_length_** word.
