# Get Element from Position

Just like you can search for an element and get its index, you can also search 
for an index and get the data in it!

Example:
```python
# To access data at an index, just say the list name and index number in brackets

list_of_sports_Santa_watches = ["football", "soccer", "ultimate frisbee"]
print(list_of_sports_Santa_watches[2]) # Prints "ultimate frisbee"
```

Finish the get_second_elem function so it always returns the second element in the list.
Because the first one looked at us funny.
