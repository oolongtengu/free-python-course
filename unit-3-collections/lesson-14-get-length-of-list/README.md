# Get Length of List

It's important to know how to measure your list size.

The length function len() will help you satisfy that need!

```python
things_you_might_find_in_the_garbage = ["rats", "trash", "dumpster divers", "treasure"]
print(len(things_you_might_find_in_the_garbage)) # Prints 4
```

And remember, if anyone ever asks...
"It's not the size of your list that matters, it's the accuracy of your data"
