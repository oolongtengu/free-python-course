# Conditional multiplication

Define a function `conditional_multiplication` that receives a boolean and a
number and returns a number. If the boolean is True the number returned is
multiplied by 10. In other case, it returns it unchanged.

Examples:

```python
# Boolean is True, multiply it by 10
>>> conditional_multiplication(True, 2)
20

# Boolean is False, return it as it is
>>> conditional_multiplication(False, 5)
5
```
