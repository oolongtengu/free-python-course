# Change number to odd

Define a function `make_number_odd` that receives a number, adds 1 to that 
number if it is even, and returns the number.

If the original number passed is odd, just return it.

Hint: Use the % operator to determine if even or odd

Examples:

```python
>>> make_number_odd(2)
3
>>> make_number_odd(5)
5
```
